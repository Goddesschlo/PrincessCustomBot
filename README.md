DEPLOYING YOUR CUSTOMAPICORE USING RENDER
====================================================

Bring your API to life on the web in just a few minutes! 
Follow this simple step-by-step guide to get your bot commands or API running.

----------------------------------------------------
1. PUSH TO GITHUB
----------------------------------------------------

Let’s start by putting your project online.

Steps:
1. Create a new GitHub repository (example name: CustomAPICore)
2. Add or upload your files:
   - CustomAPICore.js
   - package.json
   - (optional) README.md
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

🎉 Once your code is pushed, your project is now accessible to Render!

🎉 Bonus tip 
- you can simple click "New Repository" then click on "Import a Repository" and use the following link https://github.com/FluffFaceYeti/CustomAPICommands---Tested-for-StreamElements-Fossabot
- Simply give it a name and Github will pull all the files over for you!
----------------------------------------------------
2. DEPLOY ON RENDER
----------------------------------------------------

Now let’s connect your GitHub repo to Render.

Steps:
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. Click “New +” → “Web Service”
4. Select your CustomAPICore repository.

Then set up your service like this:

- Environment: Node
- Build Command: npm install
- Start Command: npm start

Once everything looks good, click “Create Web Service.”

----------------------------------------------------
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
----------------------------------------------------

Render will automatically:
- Clone your GitHub repo
- Install your dependencies (like express)
- Run your app using node CustomAPICore.js
- Give you a live link — something like:
  https://customapicore.onrender.com

🎯 You can now use that link in StreamElements, Fossabot, or anywhere your commands call the API!

----------------------------------------------------
3. UPDATING YOUR CODE
----------------------------------------------------

Need to make changes? Easy!

1. Edit your files locally.
2. Commit and push to GitHub.
3. Render will automatically redeploy the new version.

You can also manually redeploy anytime from your Render dashboard.

----------------------------------------------------
4. IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT FREE HOSTING
----------------------------------------------------

Render’s free tier is awesome for testing — but here’s what you should know:

- The service goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- When it wakes up (the first command after a break), it takes about 50 seconds to restart.
- For full 24/7 uptime and instant responses, consider upgrading to the $7/month plan.

----------------------------------------------------
QUICK RECAP
----------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ Push your files to GitHub
2️⃣ Deploy to Render as a Web Service
3️⃣ Set Environment = Node, Build = npm install, Start = npm start
4️⃣ Get your public API link and enjoy!
💡 Upgrade if you need constant uptime

----------------------------------------------------
4. Consider Donating? 
----------------------------------------------------

While this file is free to use:

- Sometime has been spent on it ensuring it is simple and easy to follow.
- It will allow you to have commands with stored replies as well as optional things such as spaces and jokes.
- If you feel like sending a small thank you tip you can do so here.

----------------------------------------------------
5. OnRender shuts down after 15 minutes of no activity?
----------------------------------------------------
- The free version does that, But there is a way to trick it!
- Create a StreamElements Timer 
- Have the timer run ever 10 minutes when you are live 
- have the response be $(urlfetch https://yourusername.onrender.com/ping)
- So if your OnRender service is called waffles it would be $(urlfetch https://waffles.onrender.com/ping)
- Set the chat lines to zero
- StreamElements will now ping your service every 10 minutes. Stopping the service from shutting down while you are live.
